Testing a code snippet
=====================

This one should work now
---------------------
Here is a code snippet from a Python file.  

[!code-python[Main](codefiles/create-workspace.py?name=writeConfig)]

This one is what we are adding
---------------------

Here is that same snippet from a Jupyter notebook.

[!code-ipynb[Main](codefiles/create-workspace.ipynb?name=writeConfig)]

If the two snippets are the same then we are GOOD!
